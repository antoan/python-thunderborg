First off I'm assuming you have forked this API and want to either
contribute to or derive your own API from it. In either case you will
be building a virtual environment to do your work in.

.. note::

   I usually do most of my work on my laptop and then check it into my
   GitHub account. I'll them check it out on a Raspberry PI to run tests.
   I may do some editing on the RPI and check it in from there, but the
   RPI is a lot slower than my laptop, so I try to keep the work I do on
   the RPI to a minimum. This means you will need to setup a virtual
   environment on all machines that you want to work on. I also make the
   assumption that a Linux system is installed on all of these machines.
   If you use Windows I cannot help you, you can spin up a virtual machine
   on you windows box and install Linux on that if you want.

Creating a Virtual Environment
==============================

From your user account we first need to install a few packages. The below
install assumes a Debian derived OS. I don't generally use Red Hat derived
OSs, but I am sure they have some equivalent packages.

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev git


Install the Python virtual environment. The ``pip`` utility can be used to
install packages for either ``python2`` or ``python3`` there is no need to
install ``pip`` for both python versions. This is also true for the virtual
environment package which can create virtual environments for either
version of Python. The virtualenvwrapper package is a wrapper around
virtualenv that provides easy to use tools for virtualenv and will install
virtualenv for you.

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo easy_install3 pip
    $ sudo -H pip3 install virtualenvwrapper

Configure ``.bashrc`` to auto load the ``virtualenvwrapper`` package.

.. code-block:: console

    $ nano .bashrc

Then add the following line to the botton of the `.bashrc` file.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Setup the Python virtual environment.
    VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

Download ``python-thunderborg``. First **cd** into the path where you want
to put the package. If you have a forked package then change the path to
your path in the below command.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/cnobile2012/python-thunderborg.git

Create a virtual environment for `python-thunderborg`.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd /path/to/python-thunderborg
    $ mkvirtualenv tborg3 # and/or mkvirtualenv -p python2 tborg2

Next we install the packages required for developing ``python-thunderborg``.

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install -r requirements/development.txt

After the initial creation of the VE you can use these commands to activate
and deactivate a VE.

.. code-block:: console

    $ workon tborg3 # or workon tborg2
    $ deactivate

Running Tests
=============

The ``Makefile`` in the project's root should be used to run the tests as
it will automatically clean up old coverage reports and HTML documents.

.. code-block:: console

    $ make tests
    $ make tests PATH=tborg.tests.test_tborg.TestThunderBorg
    $ make tests PATH=tborg/tests/test_tborg.py:TestClassMethods.test_set_i2c_address_without_current_address

* The 1st example will run all tests.
* The 2nd example will run tests for a specific class in the
  ``test_tborg.py`` module.
* The 3rd example will run a specific test in the TestClassMethods.
